## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Structure Verification
- [ ] All fields present in response
- [ ] Field names match exactly
- [ ] Data types are correct (numbers as numbers, strings as strings)
- [ ] Arrays contain expected objects
- [ ] Nested objects structured correctly

### ✅ Data Accuracy
- [ ] Job counts match database records
- [ ] Total spent/earnings calculations correct
- [ ] Average rating accurate
- [ ] Recent jobs sorted by date (newest first)
- [ ] Recent feedback sorted by date (newest first)

### ✅ Performance Verification
- [ ] Response time under 500ms (without load)
- [ ] No timeout errors with 10+ concurrent requests
- [ ] No connection pool errors
- [ ] Consistent response times

### ✅ Frontend Integration
- [ ] Dashboard displays correctly

## What Changed (Backend Only - Invisible to Frontend)

### Before (Prisma ORM)
```typescript
// Customer Dashboard - 5 separate queries
const [jobStats, totalSpent, pendingFeedback, recentJobs, recentFeedback] =
  await Promise.all([
    this.prisma.jobs.groupBy({...}),
    this.prisma.payments.aggregate({...}),
    this.prisma.jobs.count({...}),
    this.prisma.jobs.findMany({...}),
    this.prisma.ratings_feedback.findMany({...}),
  ]);
```

### After (Raw SQL - Optimized)
```typescript
// Customer Dashboard - 3 optimized queries
const [basicStats] = await this.prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT ...`;
const recentJobs = await this.prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT ...`;
const recentFeedback = await this.prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT ...`;
```

**Result**: Same data, faster delivery, fewer connections used.

## If You Notice Any Differences

If you see ANY differences in the response format or data:
1. Check that the data is actually different in the database
2. Verify the endpoint URL is correct
3. Ensure authentication token is valid
4. Compare response field by field

The optimization **only changed HOW we query the database**, not WHAT data we return.
