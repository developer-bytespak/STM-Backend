## 🔄 **End-to-End Flow Example**

### **Scenario: Customer books toilet repair**

```
1. Customer searches "toilet" in zipcode "10001"
   GET /search?query=toilet&zipcode=10001
   ↓
   Returns: "Toilet Clog" service with available providers

2. Customer clicks "Toilet Clog" service
   Shows: ABC Plumbing (4.8★), XYZ Plumbing (4.5★)

3. Customer selects ABC Plumbing and fills form
   Answers: {
     "urgency": "Emergency",
     "toilet_type": "Standard"
   }

4. Customer submits booking
   POST /jobs/create
   {
     "serviceId": 5,
     "providerId": 42,
     "answers": {"urgency": "Emergency", "toilet_type": "Standard"},
     "location": "123 Main St",
     "zipcode": "10001",
     "preferredDate": "2025-10-10"
   }
   ↓
   Backend creates:
   - Job (status: new)
   - Chat
   - Initial message: "📋 New Toilet Clog Request..."
   - Notification to SP
   - Response deadline: 1 hour

5. SP receives notification
   GET /provider/pending-jobs
   ↓
   Shows job with customer details

6. SP accepts job
   POST /provider/jobs/123/respond
   { "action": "accept" }
   ↓
   Backend:
   - Job status → in_progress
   - System message added to chat
   - Customer notified

7. Customer and SP chat
   GET /customer/chats  (customer)
   GET /provider/chats  (provider)
   ↓
   Both see the chat

8. They exchange messages
   POST /chat/:id/messages
   { "message": "What time can you arrive?" }
   ↓
   Real-time messaging

9. SP completes job
   (Payment & rating flow - separate APIs)
```

---

### **Scenario: Provider requests new service**

```
1. SP wants to offer "Pool Cleaning"
   POST /provider/request-new-service
   {
     "serviceName": "Pool Cleaning",
     "category": "Exterior Cleaner",
     "description": "...",
     "suggestedQuestions": {...}
   }
   ↓
   service_requests created (status: pending)
   LSM notified

2. LSM reviews
   GET /lsm/service-requests/pending
   ↓
   Sees "Pool Cleaning" request

3. LSM approves
   POST /lsm/service-requests/45/approve
   ↓
   lsm_approved: true
   All admins notified

4. Admin reviews
   GET /admin/service-requests/pending
   ↓
   Sees LSM-approved "Pool Cleaning"

5. Admin approves
   POST /admin/service-requests/45/approve
   ↓
   TRANSACTION:
   - Creates service in `services` table
   - Links SP in `provider_services` table
   - Updates request status
   - Notifies SP
   ↓
   "Pool Cleaning" is now LIVE!

6. Customers can now search and book "Pool Cleaning"
```

## 🎯 **Key Design Decisions**

| Decision | Implementation | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Accept/Reject** | Single endpoint with action param | Efficient, less code duplication |
| **Document action** | Single endpoint (verify/reject) | Consistent with job response pattern |
| **Service deletion** | Soft delete (status: rejected) | Preserve data, prevent broken references |
| **LSM per region** | Enforced unique constraint | One manager per region rule |
| **Dual approval** | LSM → Admin workflow | Quality control for new services |
| **Ban protection** | Check active jobs first | Prevent disruption to customers |
| **Initial message** | Auto-formatted job details | SP gets all info immediately |
