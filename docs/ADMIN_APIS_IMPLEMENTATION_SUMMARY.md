## üìÅ **Files Created/Modified**

### **Created:**
- `src/modules/admin/dto/ban-customer.dto.ts` - DTO for banning customers

### **Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added CustomerStatus enum and customer ban fields
- `src/modules/admin/admin.service.ts` - Added all 9 service methods (~1,160 new lines)
- `src/modules/admin/admin.controller.ts` - Added all 9 controller endpoints

---

## üîí **Security Features**

1. **All endpoints protected** by `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)` and `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)`
2. **Max pagination limit** enforced (100) to prevent abuse
3. **Banned customer check:** Added validation to prevent already-banned customers from being banned again
4. **Detailed error messages** for debugging and admin clarity
5. **Transaction safety:** Ban operations use database transactions for atomicity

1. **Dashboard:** Parallel queries using `Promise.all()` for ~10 simultaneous COUNT operations
2. **Pagination:** Max limit of 100 enforced on all list endpoints
3. **Date handling:** Proper date parsing for YYYY-MM-DD format queries
4. **Efficient joins:** Only selected necessary fields to reduce payload size
5. **Fresh data:** No caching for accurate real-time admin data

## üé® **API Response Patterns**

### **List Endpoints:**
```typescript
{
  data: [...],
  pagination: {
    total: number,
    page: number,
    limit: number,
    totalPages: number
  }
}
```

### **Detail Endpoints:**
```typescript
{
  [entity]: {...},
  statistics: {...},
  recent[Items]: [...],
  ...
}
```

### **Action Endpoints (Ban/Unban):**

  status: string,
  message: string,
  ...additionalDetails
}
```

### **2. Smart Filtering**
- Case-insensitive search on all text fields
- Partial keyword matching (e.g., "de" matches "Development" and "Design")
- Date range with end-of-day handling

### **3. Job Answers Inclusion**
Dispute details include `job.answers_json` so admin can see original agreements

### **4. Recent Activity Tracking**
Dashboard tracks last 24 hours activity for trend analysis

### **5. Regional Insights**
Top regions by revenue for strategic decision-making

---

## üß™ **Testing Endpoints**

### **Dashboard:**
```bash
GET /admin/dashboard
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

### **Customers:**
```bash
# List
GET /admin/customers?search=alice&region=NYC&minJobs=5&status=active&page=1&limit=20

# Details
GET /admin/customers/1

# Ban
POST /admin/customers/1/ban
Body: { "reason": "Multiple complaints" }

# Unban
POST /admin/customers/1/unban
```

### **Disputes:**
```bash
# List
GET /admin/disputes?status=pending&region=NYC&raisedBy=customer&page=1

# Details
GET /admin/disputes/1
```

### **Jobs:**
```bash
GET /admin/jobs?status=in_progress&region=NYC&service=Plumbing&customerId=5&providerId=10&minPrice=100&maxPrice=1000&fromDate=2025-10-01&toDate=2025-10-09&page=1
```

### **Reports:**
```bash
GET /admin/reports/regions
```

## üìù **Additional Notes**

### **Banned Customer Job Creation Check:**
As discussed, you need to add this validation in your **jobs creation module** (not admin module):

```typescript
// In src/modules/jobs/jobs.service.ts (or wherever job creation happens)
async createJob(customerId: number, ...) {
  const customer = await this.prisma.customers.findUnique({
    where: { id: customerId },
    select: { status: true }
  });

  if (customer.status === 'banned') {
    throw new ForbiddenException('Your account is suspended. Contact support.');
  }

  // ... continue with job creation
}
```

### **Customer Status Enum:**
The new `CustomerStatus` enum supports three states:
- `active` - Normal customer
- `banned` - Permanently suspended
- `suspended` - Temporarily suspended (for future use)

### **Chat Access for Banned Providers:**
Chats remain accessible to customers after provider ban for evidence/reference. The chat service should block banned providers from sending/viewing messages.
