}
```
**Expected:**
- [ ] Returns 401 Unauthorized

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Verification

### Password Security
- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt in database
- [ ] Salt rounds = 12
- [ ] Passwords are never returned in API responses
- [ ] Password comparison is timing-safe

### Token Security
- [ ] Access tokens expire after configured time (24h default)
- [ ] Refresh tokens expire after configured time (7d default)
- [ ] Refresh tokens are hashed before storage
- [ ] Refresh tokens are rotated on refresh
- [ ] JWT tokens include: email, sub (userId), role

### Database Security
- [ ] User creation uses transactions
- [ ] Email has unique constraint
- [ ] Profile queries exclude password field
- [ ] Role-specific profiles are created atomically

---

## üìä Database Verification

After running tests, verify in your database:

### Users Table
```sql
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role, 
       length(password) as password_length,
       length(refresh_token) as refresh_token_length,
       is_email_verified, last_login
FROM users;
```
**Check:**
- [ ] Password length is ~60 characters (bcrypt hash)
- [ ] Refresh token length is ~60 characters (bcrypt hash)
- [ ] `last_login` is updated after login
- [ ] Email is unique

### Customers Table
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE user_id = {userId};
```
**Check:**
- [ ] Customer profile exists for customer users
- [ ] `user_id` matches the user's ID

### Role-Specific Tables
```sql
-- For LSM users
SELECT * FROM local_service_managers WHERE user_id = {userId};

-- For Admin users
SELECT * FROM admin WHERE user_id = {userId};
```
**Check:**
- [ ] Appropriate role profile is created
- [ ] Foreign key relationship is correct

## üîÑ Token Lifecycle Verification

### Step-by-Step Token Flow
1. [ ] User registers ‚Üí tokens generated
2. [ ] User makes request with access token ‚Üí succeeds
3. [ ] Wait 24+ hours (or change JWT_EXPIRES_IN to "1m" for testing)
4. [ ] Access token expires ‚Üí request fails with 401
5. [ ] User refreshes token ‚Üí new tokens generated
6. [ ] Old refresh token invalidated
7. [ ] User makes request with new access token ‚Üí succeeds
8. [ ] User logs out ‚Üí refresh token removed
9. [ ] User tries to refresh ‚Üí fails with 401
10. [ ] User must login again

---

## üìù Code Quality Verification

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```
- [ ] No linting errors in `oauth` module
- [ ] All imports are correct
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

### Type Checking
- [ ] All service methods have proper return types
- [ ] DTOs are properly typed
- [ ] Prisma queries are type-safe

---

## üöÄ Performance Verification

### Password Hashing
- [ ] Registration doesn't take too long (bcrypt is intentionally slow)
- [ ] Login doesn't take too long
- [ ] Consider async/await for non-blocking operations

### Database Queries
- [ ] Transactions are properly implemented
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Indexes are used for email lookups

---

## üìö Documentation Verification

- [ ] `PHASE_2_SETUP.md` exists and is comprehensive
- [ ] `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` exists and is helpful
- [ ] `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` (this file) is complete
- [ ] JSDoc comments on all public methods
- [ ] README or main documentation references OAuth module

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'"
**Solution:** Run `npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs`

### Issue: "PrismaService is not defined"
**Solution:** Ensure `PrismaService` is in `oauth.module.ts` providers

### Issue: "Column 'password' does not exist"
**Solution:** Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`

### Issue: "JWT_SECRET is not defined"
**Solution:** Add `JWT_SECRET` to `.env` file

### Issue: "Role enum mismatch"
**Solution:** Ensure Prisma `Role` enum matches TypeScript `UserRole` enum

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

After completing all checks above:

- [ ] All functional tests pass
- [ ] All security checks pass
- [ ] All database verifications pass
- [ ] No linting or build errors
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Database schema is up to date

---

## üéØ Ready for Phase 3?

If all checks above pass, you're ready to proceed to **Phase 3: Authentication Endpoints**!

Phase 3 will add:
- Authentication controller endpoints
- Swagger documentation
- Custom decorators
- Rate limiting
- Request/response DTOs

---

**Need Help?** 
- Check `PHASE_2_SETUP.md` for detailed explanations
- Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for API usage
- Review the `oauth.service.ts` code comments

**Found an Issue?**
Document it and fix before moving to Phase 3!
